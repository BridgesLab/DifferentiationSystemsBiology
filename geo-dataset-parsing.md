Systems Biology Analysis of 3T3-L1 Differentiation
========================================================

This was based on the tools learned about in the Coursera course.  This code was most recently run on Sun Oct 27 15:18:56 2013 and is stored at /Users/davebridges/Documents/Research/differentiation.

Dataset Acquisition
--------------------


```
## Parsing....
```


The data was obtained from GEO using the dataset in GEO accession GSE6794, which is described in (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2007.01.005">Cheung et al. 2007</a>).  This file is described as:

**3T3-L1 fibroblasts are a commonly used in vitro model for adipogenesis.  When induced with hormones, they differentiate into mature fat cells.  Here, microarrays were used to study 3T3-L1 adipose differentiation through time.**

The file was downloaded, annotated and reformatted into an input file for GATE.  This file was saved as **Differentiation Time Course.clu**.
