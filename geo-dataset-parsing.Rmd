Systems Biology Analysis of 3T3-L1 Differentiation
========================================================

This was based on the tools learned about in the Coursera course.  This code was most recently run on `r date()` and is stored at `r getwd()`

Dataset Acquisition
--------------------

```{r data-entry, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(GEOquery)
library(knitcitations)
geo_accession <- 'GDS2660'
gds <- getGEO(geo_accession, destdir=getwd())
```

The data was obtained from GEO using the dataset in GEO accession `r geo_accession`, which is described in `r citep("10.1016/j.cmet.2007.01.005")`.


References

```{r bibliography, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
